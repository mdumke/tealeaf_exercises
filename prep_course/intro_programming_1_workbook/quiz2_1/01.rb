# Let's do some "ASCII Art" (a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the days before computers had video screens).

# For this exercise, write a one-line program that creates 10 lines of the following:

# The Flintstones Rock!
#  The Flintstones Rock!
#   The Flintstones Rock!

10.times { |n| p ' ' * n + 'The Flintstones Rock!' }
