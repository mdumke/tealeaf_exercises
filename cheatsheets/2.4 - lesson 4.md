## Lecture 7 (Ajax, Slugs, Simple Roles, Time Zones)

- Ajax is especially important when you have an 'expensive' page with a lot of information to fetch per request
- basic ajax-structure:
- `
$(document).ready(function () {
  $('#hit_form input').click(function () { // 1. unobstrusive js event listener
    $.ajax({ // 2. trigger ajax request
      type: 'POST',
      url: '/player/hit',
      data: {param1: 'hi', param2: 'there'}
    }).done(function (msg) { // 3. handle response
      $('#some_element').html(msg);
    });
  });
});
`
- Rails helps with abstracting from this schema so ajax can be less messy
- to ajaxify a link, use `remote: true` in the link_to-helper; this will add a `data-remote?'true'` to the link-html and a piece of javascript will convert the link to an ajax-call by building the above call
- on the server side, the request will be handled `as JS`
- to respond to different formats, use `respond_to do |format| format.html { ... } format.js { ... } end`
- inside the js-response, you could return a serialized object like `render json: @post`
- the default (no block given) will be that Rails tries to render a javascript template (action_name
.js.erb)
- in the js-template we have access to the instance variables, e.g. `alert('... <%= @post.title %> ...');`, which is more powerful than pure javascript
- of course, the elements to be changed by the javascript have to be identifiable, so use something like `id="post_<%= @post.id %>"
- think about graceful degradation: providing an ajax- and an html-way helps browsers without javascript (if you choose to do so)

- slugs are unique identifiers that are not just the ids
- slugs make for nicer urls that will get SEO credits when important key-words are there
- urls are generated using the named routes helpers, e.g. `post_path(post)`, and post_path will call `to_param` on its argument: `post_path(post.to_param)`, so if we overwrite this method: define a `to_param` instance method on the object (e.g. the post) that does not return the id but the slug: `def to_param; self.slug; end`
- slugs can be stored in their own database-column for the model
- we may want a corresponding `generate_slug-method` on the model (create a nice regexp for example) that returns a unique slug, e.g. `def generate_slug; self.slug = title.gsub(' ', '-').downcase; end`
- you can hook the slug generation into an ActiveRecord Callback, e.g. (after_validation :generate_slug)
- the livecycle-hooks provided by ActiveRecord are `save, valid, before_validation, validate, after_validation, before_save, before_create, create, after_create, after_save, after_commit`
- if you care about bookmarking, do not change slugs
- remember that once you start using slugs, make sure that every object actually has a slug (can be done, e.g. by calling save on all objects - which you might not want to do in production...)
- of course, when you use slugs, you have to retrieve objects by slug instead of id
- when you need slugs that don't change, hook slug creation into the before_create callback
- there are a lot of gems to help with slugging. 'Friendly Id' is very powerful but not so simple to use
- to make sure slugs are unique, you might want to append integers to slugs in order to distinguish them

- roles are typically introduced by setting up a `user-has-many-roles` and `role-has-many-permissions`-association structure
- then when a user wants to perform an action, you have to search through all the permissions and see if they're allowed to do what they want (which is now slowing down everything - try to convince clients to back away from introducing finegrained control that clients love...)
- a much simpler way is this: add a role-column to your user-model that takes a string, and provide a simple check on the model like `def admin?; self.role == 'admin'; end`
- now in the controller, to guard a certain action, we can simply say `before_action :require_admin`
- note that when we have a `require_admin` method we can refactor the application controller to have a general `access denied`-method that checks and redirects
- the default timezone is UTC, in strftime it is %Z that sets the timezone
- set the default timezone in application.rb (that's the first thing you want to do when working with timezones)
- there is a rake task related to timezones, that will output all valid timezone-strings
- to keep track of a user's timezone, create an appropriate column of type string
- to create a dropdown with timezones to choose from, use an `f.time_zone_select :time_zone, ActiveSupport::TimeZone.us_zones` form helper that is new in Rails 4, `ActiveSupport::TimeZone` has a number of helper methods that return lists of time zones, so
- to display a time in the zone a user has set, use `some_time.in_time_zone(current_user.time_zone)` but make sure there is a current user and they have a time zone set
- handle zime zone conversion in some display_time view helper function


## lecture 8 (APIs, Modules, Gems)

- when building APIs be aware of which type of request you want to answer to and distinguish by format (e.g. .js, .json, .xml)
- authentication for APIs works with keys that are generated when you register
- don't just change your API, but be careful with API versioning
- for twilio, the date of the API version and the secret key are part of the URLs you use to communicate with the APIs

- as an example of when modules are useful, think of the resources we can vote on: for each one we need vote-count methods
- to add a new module, first extend the autoload-paths in application.rb by adding the line `config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root)/lib)` so that we can put modules into the lib directory
- remember that the convention for new modules is to end their names in 'able' like Voteable
- here's a bit of metaprogramming given by ActiveSupport::Concern:

module Voteable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included
    # this will be executed when the module gets included
  end

  def my instance_method
    # this will be available on all instances of
    # the class that includes the module
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def my_class_method
      # this will be a class method available to the your class if you
      # include me
    end
  end
end

- when we include the module into a class via `include Voteable`, ActiveSupport will make sure, the class- and instance-methods we defined in the module are included in the class and its instances
- in the case of Voteables, we can define the `has_many :votes, as: :voteable`-association in the included method
- in the sample app it is possible to remove every vote-related code from the classes where we include the voteable-module
- before ActiveSupport::Concern there was a bit of metaprogramming necessary to include methods:

module Voteable
  def self.included(base)
    base.send(:include, InstanceMethods)
    base.extend ClassMethods

    base.class_eval do
      my_class_method
    end
  end

  module InstanceMethods
    ...
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def my_class_method
      puts "Hello from your class method"
    end
  end
end

- factoring out the slugging is a bit harder because for different classes we would like to specify different attributes as the basis of the slug
- ideally in the model we would like to include the Sluggable-module and then call something like `sluggable_column :title`
- to achieve this, take a few steps: 1) define a class_attribute like `:slug_column`, 2) define a class method like `sluggable_column` that sets the variable passed to the class_attribute, and 3) use this attribute when generating the slug: `self.send(self.class.slug_column.to_sym)`
- for every class, we can just open it up and add class_attributes using `class_attribute :some_key` and then we have getters and setters on the class for this key



- to create a gem, use a gem called `gemcutter` (0.7.1 works well, maybe others have a problem?)
- start by creating a new directory outside the rails project, like `voteable-gem` and put gem-specification file into it like `voteable.gemspec`
- the specification file might look like this:

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name = 'voteable'
  s.version = '0.0.0'
  s.date = '2015-10-05'
  s.summary = 'A voting gem'
  s.description = 'Whatever'
  s.authors = ['Some One', 'S. O. Else']
  s.email = 'me@your.place'
  s.files = ['lib/voteable.rb'] # specifies where the files are
  s.homepage = 'http://github.com'
end

- now create a lib-directory and inside put the module definition (module-name and file-name have to match)
- to build the gem, run `gem build voteable.gemspec` from the gem's root directory
- the say `gem push voteable_whatever_extension_0.0.0.gem
- the first time you push you need a password
- to check remotely which gems are on rubygems.org, run `gem list -r my_gem_name`
- now with the gem published, we can include it in our gemfile
- in order to actually use the new gem with our new module, we have to require the file; a good place is in application_controller.rb, e.g. under `require 'rails/all'` add `require 'voteable_gem_blah'` (and of course mix in the module name at the relevant places)
- when changing the gem, you might want to specify the version-number in the gemfile so that you are sure Rails uses the updated version
- for developing without publishing the full gem, specify the full path in the gemfile like `gem 'voteable', path: '/full/path/to/gem/directory'`
- to remove a gem from rubygems, use `gem yank my_voteable_gem -v '0.0.0'`
