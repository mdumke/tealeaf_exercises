## Lecture 7 (Ajax, Slugs, Simple Roles, Time Zones)

- Ajax is especially important when you have an 'expensive' page with a lot of information to fetch per request
- basic ajax-structure:
- `
$(document).ready(function () {
  $('#hit_form input').click(function () { // 1. unobstrusive js event listener
    $.ajax({ // 2. trigger ajax request
      type: 'POST',
      url: '/player/hit',
      data: {param1: 'hi', param2: 'there'}
    }).done(function (msg) { // 3. handle response
      $('#some_element').html(msg);
    });
  });
});
`
- Rails helps with abstracting from this schema so ajax can be less messy
- to ajaxify a link, use `remote: true` in the link_to-helper; this will add a `data-remote?'true'` to the link-html and a piece of javascript will convert the link to an ajax-call by building the above call
- on the server side, the request will be handled `as JS`
- to respond to different formats, use `respond_to do |format| format.html { ... } format.js { ... } end`
- inside the js-response, you could return a serialized object like `render json: @post`
- the default (no block given) will be that Rails tries to render a javascript template (action_name
.js.erb)
- in the js-template we have access to the instance variables, e.g. `alert('... <%= @post.title %> ...');`, which is more powerful than pure javascript
- of course, the elements to be changed by the javascript have to be identifiable, so use something like `id="post_<%= @post.id %>"
- think about graceful degradation: providing an ajax- and an html-way helps browsers without javascript (if you choose to do so)

- slugs are unique identifiers that are not just the ids
- slugs make for nicer urls that will get SEO credits when important key-words are there
- urls are generated using the named routes helpers, e.g. `post_path(post)`, and post_path will call `to_param` on its argument: `post_path(post.to_param)`, so if we overwrite this method: define a `to_param` instance method on the object (e.g. the post) that does not return the id but the slug: `def to_param; self.slug; end`
- slugs can be stored in their own database-column for the model
- we may want a corresponding `generate_slug-method` on the model (create a nice regexp for example) that returns a unique slug, e.g. `def generate_slug; self.slug = title.gsub(' ', '-').downcase; end`
- you can hook the slug generation into an ActiveRecord Callback, e.g. (after_validation :generate_slug)
- the livecycle-hooks provided by ActiveRecord are `save, valid, before_validation, validate, after_validation, before_save, before_create, create, after_create, after_save, after_commit`
- if you care about bookmarking, do not change slugs
- remember that once you start using slugs, make sure that every object actually has a slug (can be done, e.g. by calling save on all objects - which you might not want to do in production...)
- of course, when you use slugs, you have to retrieve objects by slug instead of id
- when you need slugs that don't change, hook slug creation into the before_create callback
- there are a lot of gems to help with slugging. 'Friendly Id' is very powerful but not so simple to use
- to make sure slugs are unique, you might want to append integers to slugs in order to distinguish them

- roles are typically introduced by setting up a `user-has-many-roles` and `role-has-many-permissions`-association structure
- a full fledged way for managing roles is to build a roles table and a permissions table that defines who can perform which actions
- then when a user wants to perform an action, you have to search through all the permissions and see if they're allowed to do what they want (which is now slowing down everything - try to convince clients to back away from introducing finegrained control that clients love...)
- a much simpler way is this: add a role-column to your user-model that takes a string, and provide a simple check on the model like `def admin?; self.role == 'admin'; end`
- now in the controller, to guard a certain action, we can simply say `before_action :require_admin`
- note that when we have a `require_admin` method we can refactor the application controller to have a general `access denied`-method that checks and redirects

- the default timezone is UTC, in strftime it is %Z that sets the timezone
- set the default timezone in application.rb (that's the first thing you want to do when working with timezones)
- there is a rake task related to timezones, that will output all valid timezone-strings
- to keep track of a user's timezone, create an appropriate column of type string
- to create a dropdown with timezones to choose from, use an `f.time_zone_select :time_zone, ActiveSupport::TimeZone.us_zones` form helper that is new in Rails 4, `ActiveSupport::TimeZone` has a number of helper methods that return lists of time zones, so
- to display a time in the zone a user has set, use `some_time.in_time_zone(current_user.time_zone)` but make sure there is a current user and they have a time zone set
- handle zime zone conversion in some display_time view helper function


## lecture 8 (APIs, Modules, Gems)

- when building APIs be aware of which type of request you want to answer to and distinguish by format (e.g. .js, .json, .xml)
- authentication for APIs works with keys that are generated when you register
- don't just change your API, but be careful with API versioning
- for twilio, the date of the API version and the secret key are part of the URLs you use to communicate with the APIs
- aside: using curl with rails. The scenario: I want to have access to, say, and API that is restricted, e.g. only a login user can access some json data at localhost:3000/api/users/2.json. The problem is that in order to perform this request we need to be logged in, i.e. the user_id needs to be in the session. If we have a file containing the session, say session.txt or just session, we can simply send it along the with request like so: `curl localhost:3000/api/users/2.json -b session`.
- But how do we get this file? We have to login first, i.e. send a POST request with the necessary credentials to the login endpoint, e.g. `curl -X POST localhost:3000/login -F username=matthias -F password=123`. This will fail, of course, because for every POST request Rails will check the authenticity token, which we don't have yet. So one more step back. Here's the complete process:
- 1. Send a GET request to the login point, store the cookie and grep out the auth token: `curl localhost:3000/login -c session | ag csrf-token`
- 2. POST to the login point with your credentials, along with the token and the session, and make sure to store the session that is returned, because it will contain the user_id: `curl -X POST localhost:3000/login -F username=matthias -F password=123 -F authenticity_token=abc..xyz -b session -c session`
- 3. Now to perform requests as the logged in user, simply send the session along when accessing the api: `curl localhost:3000/api/users/2.json -b session`

- as an example of when modules are useful, think of the resources we can vote on: for each one we need vote-count methods
- to add a new module, first extend the autoload-paths in application.rb by adding the line `config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root)/lib)` so that we can put modules into the lib directory
- remember that the convention for new modules is to end their names in 'able' like Voteable
- here's a bit of metaprogramming given by ActiveSupport::Concern:

module Voteable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included
    # this will be executed when the module gets included
  end

  def my instance_method
    # this will be available on all instances of
    # the class that includes the module
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def my_class_method
      # this will be a class method available to the your class if you
      # include me
    end
  end
end

- when we include the module into a class via `include Voteable`, ActiveSupport will make sure, the class- and instance-methods we defined in the module are included in the class and its instances
- in the case of Voteables, we can define the `has_many :votes, as: :voteable`-association in the included method
- in the sample app it is possible to remove every vote-related code from the classes where we include the voteable-module
- before ActiveSupport::Concern there was a bit of metaprogramming necessary to include methods:

module Voteable
  def self.included(base)
    base.send(:include, InstanceMethods)
    base.extend ClassMethods

    base.class_eval do
      my_class_method
    end
  end

  module InstanceMethods
    ...
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def my_class_method
      puts "Hello from your class method"
    end
  end
end

- factoring out the slugging is a bit harder because for different classes we would like to specify different attributes as the basis of the slug
- ideally in the model we would like to include the Sluggable-module and then call something like `sluggable_column :title`
- to achieve this, take a few steps: 1) define a class_attribute like `:slug_column`, 2) define a class method like `sluggable_column` that sets the variable passed to the class_attribute, and 3) use this attribute when generating the slug: `self.send(self.class.slug_column.to_sym)`
- for every class, we can just open it up and add class_attributes using `class_attribute :some_key` and then we have getters and setters on the class for this key



- start by creating a new directory outside the rails project, like `voteable-gem` and put gem-specification file into it like `voteable.gemspec`
- the specification file might look like this:

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name = 'voteable'
  s.version = '0.0.0'
  s.date = '2015-10-05'
  s.summary = 'A voting gem'
  s.description = 'Whatever'
  s.authors = ['Some One', 'S. O. Else']
  s.email = 'me@your.place'
  s.files = ['lib/voteable.rb'] # specifies where the files are
  s.homepage = 'http://github.com'
end

- now create a lib-directory and inside put the module definition (module-name and file-name have to match)
- to build the gem, run `gem build voteable.gemspec` from the gem's root directory
- to publish a gem, use a gem called `gemcutter`
- then say `gem push voteable_whatever_extension_0.0.0.gem
- the first time you push you need a password
- to check remotely which gems are on rubygems.org, run `gem list -r my_gem_name`
- now with the gem published, we can include it in our gemfile
- in order to actually use the new gem with our new module, we have to require the file; a good place is in application_controller.rb, e.g. under `require 'rails/all'` add `require 'voteable_gem_blah'` (and of course mix in the module name at the relevant places)
- when changing the gem, you might want to specify the version-number in the gemfile so that you are sure Rails uses the updated version
- for developing without publishing the full gem, specify the full path in the gemfile like `gem 'voteable', path: '/full/path/to/gem/directory'`
- there is a little hack for specifying the path relative to the app's root dir (works on unix, at least): 'path: "#{ system('pwd') }/relative/path/to/gem"'
- to remove a gem from rubygems, use `gem yank my_voteable_gem -v '0.0.0'`

## bonus: 2-factor authentication with twilio

- two factor authentication means: on login, the app generates and stores a pin, which gets send to the user (via twilio), the user then has to enter the pin in order to complete the login process
- at registration time (or when turning on 2-factor-authentication) the user has to enter a phone number
- create pin(string) and phone(string) to users
- add a phone field (text-field) to the registration field
- in the sessions controller, after successful login, see if a phone number is present (2-factor-auth is on), and if so, generate a pin
- you could write a `generate_pin!` method on the user model that generates a random six-digit number (`rand(10 ** 6)`)
- ? rails 4 brings an `update_column`-method, what's the difference to `update_attribute`?
- send the number via sms to the user, so sign up for twilio (with a real number or using the sandbox). Twilio works with the twilio ruby gem, and on the website you find some basic code wo send the sms
- beware not to put you API key into the project
- twilio will send a message back to your app via 'callback-urls' that you can specify
- generate a pin_path to redirect to, e.g. `myapp.com/pin`, where there is an input field for the pin
- make sure the pin-view is only displayed to users that have passed the first step with e.g. `session[:two_factor] = true` and guard the controller action
- A pin action on the sessions controller might look like this:
`
def pin
  access_denied if session[:two_factor].nil?

  if request.post? # GET will just render the template
    user = User.find_by_pin(params[:pin])
    if user
      user.remove_pin!
      session[:two_factor] = nil
      login_user!(user)
    else
      flash['error'] = 'Something is wrong with your pin'
      redirect_to pin_path
    end
  end
end
`


## bonus: pagination

- to ask for a limited set of data, use 'limit' and 'offset' as in `Post.offset(3).limit(3)` will get Posts 4, 5, and 6
- we can add a constant to that in the controller we can just say `Post.limit(Post::PER_PAGE)`
- on a model we can specify a default scope that can be used, e.g. to order the models that are returned, as for instance in `default_scope { order('created_at ASC') }`
- to determine the offset, use the params and pass an offset as the query parameter
- for navigation just use a bunch of links; it is helpful do determine a @page variable
