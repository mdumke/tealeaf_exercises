## relational databases

- find the text at http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/intro-ruby-relational-db.html
- because Rails lets you choose a database backend, it only allows for a limited number of general types to be used within a schema, they are: `:string, :text, :integer, :float, :decimal, :datetime, :timestamp, :time, :date, :binary, ` and `:boolean`
- if you have lots of data that doesn't fit easily into relational databases (e.g. lots of hierarchical information), look for some other kind of tool
- it is possible but very inconvenient to represent many-to-many relationships with two tables, each of which would have multiple (but how many?) foreign keys; The better way to solve these problems is through a third table that just connects the ids
- when designing databases, the question of *granularity* is important: how small should our units of information be? e.g. do we want to record the first name and last name separately or together. This has to be decided in the context of the application, but in general it is easier to put smaller pieces together than to break larger ones apart.
- For combining smaller pieces Rails has a `composed_of` method
- The purpose of Active Record is to abstract from writing SQL queries by hand, but in case you need them, there is a `find_by_sql`-method


## Introduction to SQL

- find the resources at http://sqlbolt.com/

### SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101

- simplest query: `SELECT col1, col2 FROM my_items;`
- get the complete dump with `SELECT * FROM my_items;`

### SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)

- conditions can be specified using WHERE and will be applied to every row in a table to check if it should be included in the result
- use multiple conditions like so: `SELECT col1, col2 FROM mytable WHERE condition1 AND / OR condition2 ... `
- common conditionals are
- `=, !=, < <=, >, >=` (numerical operators)
- `col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5` (number in a range)
- `col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10`
- `col_name IN (2, 4, 6)` (element exists in a list)
- `col_name NOT IN (2, 4, 6)`

### SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (Pt. 2)

- when working with text-data, use `=` and `!=` or `<>` for *case sensitive* and *exact* string comparisons
- use `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` for *case insensitive* yet still *exact* comparisons
- in combination with `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` it is possible to use wildcars, namely `%` to match zero or more characters (e.g. `col_name LIKE "%AT%"`) and `_` to match a single character (e.g. `col_name LIKE "AN_"`)
- all strings must be in quotes, but remember that postgres uses single quotes
- to perform efficient full-text search, don't use plain SQL but use libraries like *Apache Lucene* or *Sphinx*.

### SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results

- to remove all duplicates from a query result, use `SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2, ...`
- results can be ordered via `select ... from ... where ... ORDER BY colx ASC / DESC;`
- to restrict the number of results, use limit to specify the number to return and offset to specify where to begin: `SELECT ... LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;`
- limiting usually happens at the end of the query

### SQL Lesson 6: Multi-table queries with JOINs

- the process of breaking large datasets into smaller parts (tables) is called normalization
- to recombine tables and search across them, use joins
- in many SQL-implementations inner joins are just called joins
- when performing inner joins a cross product of the tables is generated and the rows that fulfill the `on` condition are selected
- schematic usage: `SELECT ... FROM my_table INNER JOIN another_table ORDER BY ...`

### SQL Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs

- in a `LEFT JOIN` all rows from the first table will be kept, even if there are no matching rows in the second
- a `RIGHT JOIN` keeps all the rows from the second table regardless
- a `FULL JOIN` keeps all rows event if there are no matching rows in the other tables
- missing values will be filled in with NULL-values, so we will likely have to deal with those

### SQL Lesson 8: A short note on NULLs

- NULL values are annoying because we have to specifically deal with them, so try to use sensible default-values if possible
- note that it is not always possible to avoid NULLs, e.g. when doing outer joins
- to handle those cases, use `WHERE colname IS / IS NOT NULL`

### SQL Lesson 9: Queries with expressions

- beyond querying raw data it is possible to use expressions and mathematical and string functions
- which functions are available depends on the respective database - rtfm
- use the keyword `AS` to specify aliases, e.g. `SELECT column AS better_column_name ... FROM my_table AS better_table_name_or_abbreviation ...`

### SQL Lesson 10: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 1)

- common aggregate functions are `count, min, max, avg` and `sum`
- note that `count(*)` counts all rows while `count(colname)` will only count non-null row
- use aliases for readability
- `GROUP BY colname` can be used to group by unique values in the given column
- without grouping the functions will aggregate over all data

### SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

- using `HAVING` it is possible to filter after grouping in order to select only some groups
- general schema: `SELECT ... WHERE condition GROUP BY colname HAVING group_condition;`

### SQL Lesson 12: Order of execution of a Query

- note that expressions in the select part of a query are computed *after* where-conditions, grouping and having-conditions have been applied, hence aliases from the select part are typically not accessible by the other parts

### SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows

- to simply add rows to my_table, use `INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (v11, v12, v13), (v21, v22, v23), ...;`
- you can also specify a subset of columns to set values for: `INSERT INTO my_table (col2, col5) VALES (v12, v15), (v22, v25), ...;
- note that specifying columns explicitely is forward compatible because you can later add a column to the table without having to rewrite the insert statement

### SQL Lesson 14: Updating rows

- general syntax is `UPDATE my_table SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2, ... WHERE condition`;
- this will update the fields in *all* rows that are specified by the where clause
- note: mistakes with updates are common and annyoing, to avoid damage, first perform a select query to test the condition, making sure you update the correct rows

### SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows

- general syntax: `DELETE FROM my_table WHERE condition;`
- the where clause is optional and can be left out to clear the table completely
- test the where condition before executing the delete

### SQL Lesson 16: Creating tables

- general syntax: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_table ( col1 data_type, col2, data_type, ...);
- in addition to the data type, we can also specify optional table constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `AUTOINCREMENT`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL` or `FOREIGN KEY`
- it is also possible to specify default values for each column so a full-blown specification may look like so: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE DEFAULT "", ...`.
- common data types are `INTEGER, BOOLEAN, FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL, CHARACTER(num_chars), VARCHAR(num_chars), TEXT, DATE, DATETIME,` and `BLOB` for binary data.

### SQL Lesson 17: Altering tables

- columns can be added via `ALTER TABLE mytable ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint DEFAULT default_value;`
- not all SQL-implementations allow for removing columns, but if they do, use `ALTER TABLE mytable DROP column_to_be_deleted;` to achieve this
- rename a table with `ALTER TABLE mytable RENAME TO new_table_name;`

### SQL Lesson 18: Dropping tables

- `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;` will remove the table from the database, including its schema
- note that if other tables have foreing keys to this table you might have to do some cleanup
