### haml things

- helpful website: www.htmltohaml.com, which offers a converter
- also good overview: learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/preprocessors/
- when the haml-gem is installed, you can preprocess haml to html manually with `haml index.haml index.html`
- `!!!` declare doctype html 5
- content can be written on the same line as the tag like `%h1 hello, work!`
- attributes can be added with {} and Ruby-hash syntax, e.g. `%section{ some: 'value' }`, or with () and html syntax, e.g. `%section(some="value")`
- also, Ruby code can be put on the same single line: `.item{ some: 'value' }= @item.text`
- classes and ids can be defined with `.` and `#` notation
- boolean values can simply be `true` or `false` as in Ruby
- the backslash will escape the following character, so `\= @post` will be printed as `= @post`, not being processed as Ruby but simply read as a string
- there is a Ruby helper-method for continuing with text on the same line, not introducing spaces, where the output of a block will be inserted before the succeeding text

    %p
      Click this
      = succeed "." do
        %a{ href: '#' } link

- there are a number of ways to comment out text  or blocks of code in haml:

    / this line is regular comment in html
    -# this line will not show up in html
    /
      all the lines nested
      here will not be shown

- conditional comments, e.g. for IE checking, have to be put in brackets

    /[if lt IE 9]
      %script{ src: 'html5shiv.js' }

- Filters can be used to execute code in Haml. Filters start with a colon and code is nested under them, common filters are  `cdata`, `plain`, `javascript`, `ruby`, `markdown` and a number of others
- Ruby interpolation works as expected with the "#{ some-ruby-code }" syntax
- all lines that are not interpreted will be output as plain text, which is true for html-tags as well, so if you don't want to translate html to haml, that's fine
- attribute-hashes can be stretched over multiple lines if they break after a comma
- class- and id-attributes can be defined as arrays, and will be automatically joined by haml

## lesson: The Process of going from Ideas to Products

- a prototype process for (web) applications
- 1. idea
- 2. wireframes (communication, not design) - do multiple versions of them to escape your own ideas; also, people can tell you which parts of which approach they like
- 3. Design (layouts, colors, look & feel) -> .psd
- 4. Slicing (turning the designer's .psd-files into html-mockups)
- 5. Development
- keeping these layers separate allows you to try out a number of different approaches or versions for each step
- common tools for building mockups include *balsamique* and *moqups*


## lesson: The Design to Development Handoff

- when we have the static pages, we can use a ui-controller and corresponding my_app/ui-route like `get '/ui(/:action)', controller: 'ui'` to easily access them
- set up a redirect for the production environment so no one will see the mockups
- get a list of every file in a directory using `Dir.glob('app/views/ui/*.html.haml')` which will return an Enumerable of File-objects (from which you could, e.g. build an index page to display all files as links)
- note that we're using sass, which is even shorter than scss (read up on sass at sass-lang.com)
- you can group sass-rails, coffee-rails and uglifier under the :assets group in the Gemfile [but as of rails 4 that is not good practice anymore]
- ? what does pry-nav do? [it adds basic next, continue, and step functionality to pry]
- read about the handoff process at 'blog.hashrocket.com/posts/managing-design-handoffs-with-the-ui-controller'
- when you start designing, the nav should be empty - only fill it up once you know about the features of the app


## lesson: Building Views from Mockups

- if you have a sliced html-page, start by rebuilding it step by step, starting with the views and create the controllers, models, and routes you need to support this
- when rebuilding, you can rely on copying and pasting to make sure the styles still apply and javascript is still intact


## lesson: seeding data

- helpful for development or for letting clients play around with the app in an early stage
- run `rake db:seed` to put the seeds into the database or `rake db:setup` to re-create and re-fill it



## stuff

- in Rails 4, scopes need a callable object, so e.g. `has_many :videos, order: :name` now becomes `has_many :videos, ->{ order(:name) }`
- specify a ruby version in a file named `.ruby-version` and rvm will automatically switch to the correct version (simply put e.g. `2.1.2` inside the file)
- and similarly for associating a particular gemset with a project, create a `.ruby-gemset` file and just put the name in there, like `this_special_project`
