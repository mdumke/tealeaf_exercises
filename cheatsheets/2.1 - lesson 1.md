## Lecture 1

- prior to bundler gems were installed into one place, so switching between projects might require de- and reinstalling gems. Bundler introduces a sandbox, reads the versions of gems from the Gemfile and puts them together for a given project
- using `bundle exec` makes sure that the gem-versions intended to be used by bundler are actually used, not some system version
- most important files to inspect when starting a new project: `database.yml`, `Gemfile`, and `routes.rb`
- for real projects, try to mimic the production environment closely locally
- the three relevant pieces of a request are the http-verb, the url and the parameters; the router uses all three of those to determine which action to route to
- in `application.rb` we set application defaults like timezone or language defaults
- put rake tasks in lib/tasks/
- use `robots.txt` to guide search engines, e.g. if you don't want them to load expensive sites - but these are suggestions, not forcings
- as of rails 4 the app provides `/rails/info` that has information about routes (put in an actual route like `/posts/2` to find matching actions) as well as app-properties
- `Active Record` is not (just) the name of the Rails-class, but is a Pattern created by Martin Fowler to associate models and databases, it is an ORM-pattern (object-relational-mapper)
- ORM says: an object corresponds directly with a row in the table (which is a strong contraint for applications with complicated structure, esp. when working with multile databases, so here you would use other ORMs)
- nice trick in the rails console: `_` is the last thing that was returned, so you don't have to rewrite the last line, just say `x = _` and it will bind the previous result to x
- if the foreign key is not as you would expect by convention (resource_id), specify it for belongs_to and has-associations using `foreign_key: :some_other_attribute`
- what is a 'virtual attribute'? This refers to the medhods provided by Rails when associations are set, e.g. order in `some_user.order`, or `order=(o)` in `some_user.order = ...`. It's virtual because it behaves like an attribute but is not a column in the db
- 'mass assignment' refers to the ability to set multiple values of an object through a hash (usually the curly braces are left out)


## Postit Application Setup
- consider creating and using a gemset: list gemsets with `rvm gemset list`, create and use new ones: `rvm gemset use postit`
- run `bundle install --without production` if you want to skip installing production gems, especially the pg-gem, which breaks the app if you don't have postgres installed
- when building a new application, always start with the mockups and from there build the ERDs, the entity-relationship-diagrams that define the data structures which support this app and functionality
- Rails has a `tableize`-method that can be called on Strings and that returns the name that Rails would expect for the corresponding table, e.g. `'Person'.tableize == 'people'`
- tip: make sure your migrations run cleanly end-to-end (so don't go back and modify migration files)
- if you want to use a different naming to access by foreign key (e.g. call the person who created a post the creator, not the user) then because you deviate from the default, specify the foreign key and class name like so: `belongs_to :creator, foreign_key: 'user_id', class_name: 'User'`
- when creating a model that has associated models via foreign_keys, we can specify the foreing keys explicitely like `Post.create(text: ..., user_id: 12)` or via the associated name like `Post.create(text: ..., user: User.first)`. If the associated name deviates from the default, use this one instead: `Post.create(text: ..., creator: User.first)`


## Lecture 2
- M:M associations always use join tables
- has_and_belongs_to_many-associations (habtm) have no join model, and there is an implicit join table at the db layer
- it is strongly recommended to use `has_many-through` (hmt) because when requirements change you can add information to the join entities
- when using `resources` to generate routes, you are making endpoints publicly available to the world, so make sure you only expose the endpoints that are actually implemented. Use e.g. `resources :posts, except: [:destroy]`
- never never ever write urls as strings, use the named routes
- when calling names-routes-methods, pass in an argument for each variable element like `:post_id` and `:id`


## Rails migrations guide

- migrations are the only case where you should use a Rails generator (to get the correct timestamp)
- the generator can auto-generate migrations for adding or removing columns if you name it like `AddXXXToYYY` or `RemoveXXXFromYYY` and provide the column names and types, e.g. `rails g migration AddPartNumberToProducts part_number:string:index`
- similarly you can create a table generating migration with `CreateXXX my_first_column:string my_second_column:decimal`
- we can even generate a join table automatically: `CreateJoinTableCustomerProducts`
- using a model generator will also create the relevant migration
- migrations have 'type modifiers' to further specify the data, e.g. restrict decimal places of floats or the length of strings
- in addition to using the Rails helpers it is also possible to directly execute raw SQL in the migrations
- try to avoid `rake db:rollback`, but you can revert a migration using `revert` inside another migration (see the guide for details)
- tip: if you want to know what attributes an Active Record object has, it is useless ot look at the model, instead, take a look at the `db/schema.rb`
- start using `db/seeds.rb` and `rake db:seed` to fill the database
- the `schema.rb` is the authority for the db-structure. When setting up a new db, e.g. for testing, rails will not run all the migrations, but just use the schema-file to set up the correct schema


## Rails Routing Guide

- some rather general points:
- try to use resourceful routes, but don't force it
- use `as` to specify the named routes for route_paths and route_urls
- Rails `link_to`-method automatically calles `url_for` on its second argument, so we can create a link with `link_to 'some_text', @post`. It's also possible to specify the http-method
- there is `resources :users, :posts` to generate resourceful routes, and is it also possible to have those for resources that only exist in singular with e.g. `resource :profile`
- routes can be formed with namespaces and scopes to connect them to different controllers
- resources can be nested, but more than 1 level of nesting is not recommended; as an alternative, there is shallow-routing
- nesting can be even further simplified with concerns in case the same resource has to be nested multiple times
- resourceful routes can be amended by members and collections
- there are many possibilities for defining custom non-resourceful routes using wildcards
- routes can be constrained
- it is possible to specify redirection at the routes level
- `root` can be defined within a namespace to define e.g. an admin-root-route and a regular root-route
- resourceful routes can be customized, e.g. by deviating from the default expected controller, by changing the named helpers or by specifying constraints on dynamic parts like e.g. the id
- override default inflections in the Inflector in case of irregular pluralization
- there are some helper methods for testing routes: `assert_generates`, `assert_recognizes`, and `assert_routing`


## Rails association methods guide

- eager loading: use `includes(:association_name)` on the class to eagerly load the referenced model
- specify `inverse_of`-relationships on associations to enable load optimizations, e.g. using the same in-memory-representation. `inverse_on` can be specified on both the `belongs_to` and the `has_many` / `has_one` sides (according to the guide, this doesn't work for through-associations)
- association-queries can be customized by passing in scopes. This way, you could e.g. retrieve only results for the respective current month
- there are a number of options to customize whether or not associated objects should automatically be saved and if so, should they be validated before saving? Should dependend objects be destroyed when the parent is deleted? Or should the be touched so we know something was updated?
- if you want to rename the association on the belongs_to-side, specify foreign-key and class-name, for has_many through-associations, you have to specify the original source, e.g. `has_many :subscribers, through: :subscriptions, source: :user`


## Rails Layout and Rendering Guide

- the controller has three ways to create an http-response: `render`, `redirect_to` and `head` (which is just a set of HTTP headers)
- if you don't specify a render at the end of a controller method, rails will look for a view called `action_name.html.erb` in the controller's view path and render this
- rendering nothing can be done via `render nothing: true`, which might be useful in the context of doing Ajax requests, but using `head` provides more flexibility
- to render the view for another action within the same controller, simply use `render :other_action_view`
- similarly, to render the view from another controller use `render 'other_controller/some_action_view'`
- it is also possible to render a completely different file outside the application with `render file: '/absolute/path/to/some/view'`
- render plain text with `render plain: 'This and that'` (but rails 3 is a bit different)
- it is also possible to render plain text within the current layout using the `layout: true` option and using the `.txt.erb`-extension for the layout file
- render a simple html snippet using `render html: "<p>Blah</p>".html_safe`
- similarly, it is easy to render json, xml, and even javascript (`render js: 'alert("hi")')`
- options for render are `:content_type` (the MIME-type, default is text/html), `:layout` (defaults to the current layout, it's also possible to have no layout with `render layout: false`, `:location` for the http-location-header, and `:status` (but rails chooses the correct type automatically)
- rails will look for a layout for each controller in `app/views/layouts/controller_name.html.erb` and will default to the `application`-layout
- to set a different default layout for a controller, put `layout 'other_layout'` right after the class definition of the controller (use `except [:method_one, :method_two]` to restrict the application of this special layout)
- to change the default layout for the whole application, put `layout 'alternative_layout'` right after the class definition of the application controller
- use `layout :method_name` to call a method at runtime that will return the layout name (useful e.g. when the layout changes depending on the current user or time)
- consider using `render :bla and return` (not `&& return`) when running into the double render error
- layouts are used to specify elements that stay the same accross different views
- the view will be inserted into the layout at the `yield`-position, but together with `content_for` it is also possible to define different insertions, e.g. `yield :head` to insert content into the head section of a view
- partials are names with a leading underscore, but referenced without like `render 'menu'` or `render 'shared/menu'`
- partials can be used from layouts or from individual views
- partials can have their corresponding layouts that also start with an underscore, e.g. `render partial: 'link_area', layout: 'graybar'` will put '_link_area.html.erb' into '_graybar.html.erb'
- note that the partial only has to be specified exactly when other arguments are passed to render
- you can pass in a hash of variables to a partial's `locals`-parameter
- every partial has a local variable of the same name as the partial (w/o underscore), this can be set via `object: @some_variable`, or rendered as `render @some_variable` if everything adheres to the defaults (of course, the default name of this variable can be changed)
- rendering a partial for every instance in a collection is easy with something like `render partial: 'user', collection: @users` (or use the shorthand `render @users` when things are setup as expected)
- it is also possible to render an empty view if the collection is empty
- a `spacer-template` can be rendered between the partials of a collection like so: `render partial: @products, spacer_template: 'product_ruler'
- The `date_field` helper had a bug that prevented users from setting default date values (should be fixed in the latest Rails versions)
