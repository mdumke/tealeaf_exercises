# Lesson 3: Even more about testing

## lecture: Growing Complexity guided by tests

- run the tests often and take small steps, this way you will always know where you're at

## lecture: Interactive Debugging for Solution Discovery

- when you find a bug, write a test that reproduces it, don't just go and fix it (think: which input generated the wrong behavior)
- nice regex-tutorial on `www.regular-expression.info`
- `some_string.try(:strip)` will call `.strip` on the value only if it is not nil

## lecture: Respond to Feature Changes

- start by writing the tests for the new feature
- then while developing focus on making the feature-specific tests pass
- finally, if this breaks other, earlier tests, go back and change the tests if needed (or if they are still valid, make sure to fix the code...)

## lecture: Transactions

- example: a batch update: you might have to roll back all updates so far if one has a validation error
- read the active record transactions guide
- say we have the data to reorder queue items coming in in the form of `queue_items: [{id: 3, position: 2}, {id: 2, position: 1}]`
- do not delete a queue item if it is not in the current user's queue
- sometimes you have to reload objects in the spec after you've called a controller method that updates the object:
```ruby
describe 'controller updates a value to :y'
  item = Fabricate(:item, value = :x)
  post :change, item_id: item.id, new_value: :y
  expect(item.value).to eq :y
end
```
- This will fail because the modification of the controller will not be reflected here. To fix this, use `expect(item.reload.value).to eq :y`.
- To avoid a double-redirect-error in the controller, call `return` explicitely after the first redirect - but you can also think about refactoring so that there is only one redirect...
- use a transaction to have updates passing together. If one of the Records is invalid, a RecordInvalid-error will be raised that triggers a rollback - you can trigger those yourself as in this example:
```ruby
begin
  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
    data_array.each do |item_data|
      item = Item.find_by_id(item_data[:id])

      unless item.update_attributes!(new: 'value')
        # this will trigger a rollback
        fail(ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid)
      end
    end
  end
rescue
  #some_error_handling after the rollback
end
```

## lecture: Structural Refactor

- push down buisness logic to the model level so that the controllers don't get bloated
- when this is basically a copy-paste process, it should suffice to have the existing controller tests still test the code
- if, however, you're going to develop new features, write tests on the model level

## lecture: Skinny Controller, Fat Model

- 'fat model' does not necessarily mean that the model has a lot of code, but that it takes more responsibility
- read more at `weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/18/skinny-controller-fat-model`
- passing content from the params to the model is a bad practice because they will be too tightly coupled
- when `include_blank: true` is passed to the select_tag, it will show a blank option
- if you provide a `model#feature=(arg)` method, you can use this as a virtual attribute in e.g. `update_attributes(feature: some_value)`
- `MyModel.find_by(user: user, feature: feature)` is equivalent to `MyModel.where(user: user, feature: feature).first`

## lecture: RSpec Macros

- to extract common behavior and improve readability, use makros which should be put in `spec/supportmacros.rb`
- in the macros file, define functions that execute spec code like, e.g.
```ruby
def set_current_user
  jane = Fabricate(:user)
  session[:user_id] = jane.id
end

def clear_current_user
  session[:user_id] = nil
end

def current_user
  User.find(session[:user_id])
end
```

## lecture: Shared Examples

- example: for all actions of a controller we want to test that a user is redirected when they are not logged in; so say we're testing authentication for some controller's index action:
```ruby
it 'redirects user to the root path if they are not signed in' do
  clear_current_user
  get :index
  expect(response).to redirect_to root_path
end
```
- to reuse this, create a file `spec/support/shared_examples.rb` and put the following code in there:
```ruby
shared_examples "require_sign_in" do
  it 'redirects to the front page' do
    clear_current_user
    action
    expect(response).to redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```
- now in the controller test, transform the previous test to
```ruby
it_behaves_like 'require_sign_in' do
  let(:action) { get :index }
end
```
- note the way you can inject code to be executed at a particular point within the shared example
- this example is now easily reusable accross different actions and even controllers
- of course, shared examples can also be used on the model level (see the relish-docs for shared examples)


## lecture: Introducing Feature Specs

- So far, we haven't tested Views, Routes, Helpers and Mailers
- These will typically be tested in (vertical) integration using *feature specs*
- Think from the perspective of an actual user
- 'Horizontal integrations' could refer to RSpecs *request specs*, which are about testing multiple requests in sequences and making sure all parts play together well
- relish has a Feature spec documentation and also docs for Request specs
- Request specs specify a series of action on the controller/routes level and do not actually involve the browser
- Prior to RSpec 2.0 the distincion was not as clear


## lecture: capybara

- two styles of using capybara: 1) use the standard RSpec syntax with 'describe', 'before', 'it', and 'let', 2) a feature-DSL using 'feature', 'background', 'scenario', and 'given' (these are just aliases)
- The default-driver for Capybara is RackTest, which is fast but does not support javascript. If this is needed, look at Selenium, which uses a real browser (hence its slow) or Capybara-webkit (much faster than Selenium because it's a headless browser, but still slower than RackTest)
- For interaction-testing, Capybara can fill in forms and click buttons or links, it can also query the dom for specific Elements like `page.has_content?('foo')`


## lecture: First Feature Spec

- when adding Capybara, you only need in the test group, just add `gem 'capybara'` and require in the spec-helper-file `require capybara/rails`
- puts specs in `spec/features` and name them like, e.g. `user_signs_in_spec.rb`
- the feature spec might look like this:
```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

feature 'User signs in' do
  background do
    User.create(username: Johann)
  end

  scenario 'with existing username' do
    visit root_path
    fill_in 'Username', with: 'Johann'
    click_button 'Sign in'
    page.should have_content "Johann Do"
  end
end
```
- for filling in forms, use the field-name, id, or label-text (best practice, but requires the label to be connected to the input field)
- watch Railscast #257 on Capybara, but note that the video is somewhat older an terminology might have changed
- all the rails integration-test helper methods are available
- the launchy-gem provides a `save_and_open_page` method that we can insert in any position of the spec to see hwo the page actually looks
- to use the latest version of a gem, simply point to it with the syntax `gem 'capybara', git: 'https://github.com/...'`
- when you pass the js-true option to any spec (`it 'supports js', js: true do`) it will use selenium
- this will bring problems with database-entries, which you can solve by including the 'database_cleaner' gem and setting using transactions to false in the rails helper

# assignment: a more complicated feature spec

- it makes sense to sign in a user via a macro because this is used often in feature specs
- if a link does not have an anchor text we can search by href: `find("a[href='/video/#{my_video.id}]").click`
- you can use `save_and_open_page` from inside a `binding.pry`
- if you need to identify elements but cannot use the ids, use data-attributes like `=text_field_tag 'name[]', 'value', data: {help_id: unique_id}`
- when using data-attributes, we cannot rely on Capybara to automatically fill in fields, but we have to first find them explicitely: `find("input[data-help-id]='abc'").set(3)`, which will find the field and update the value
- another way to identify elements might be to first identify their scope or context and then select them, e.g. selecting input fields within a table row. Here, xpath is going to be helpful, e.g.:
```ruby
within(:xpath, "//tr[contains(.,'#{my_video.title}')]") do
  fill_in "the_relevant_fields_name", with: 3
end
```
- here's how to find an input element of type text within a table row:
```ruby
find(:xpath, "//tr[contains(.,'#{my_video.title}')]//input[@type='text']")
```
- xpath-syntax: the first `//` means to start anywhere in the document, the `.` refers to the current level, i.e. the tr in the examples, the second `//` looks under the previously found elements, `@` is used for querying attributes
- use helper methods to refactor xpath-expressions when you need them more often
- find the proper level of abstraction, which in feature specs can mean to rfactor out things like finding text or elements on the screen into helper methods





- what does the dir-structure for spec look like?

- some helpful command line shortcuts:
CTRL + U - Cuts text up until the cursor.
CTRL + K - Cuts text from the cursor until the end of the line
CTRL + Y - Pastes text
CTRL + E - Move cursor to end of line
CTRL + A - Move cursor to the beginning of the line
ALT + F - Jump forward to next space
ALT + B - Skip back to previous space
ALT + Backspace - Delete previous word
CTRL + W - Cut word behind cursor
