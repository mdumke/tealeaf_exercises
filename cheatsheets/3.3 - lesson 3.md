# Lesson 3: Even more about testing

## lecture: Growing Complexity guided by tests

- run the tests often and take small steps, this way you will always know where you're at

## lecture: Interactive Debugging for Solution Discovery

- when you find a bug, write a test that reproduces it, don't just go and fix it (think: which input generated the wrong behavior)
- use `binding.pry` for interactive debugging, of course
- nice regex-tutorial on `www.regular-expression.info`
- `some_string.try(:strip)` will call `.strip` on the value only if it is not nil

## lecture: Respond to Feature Changes

- start by writing the tests for the new feature
- then while developing focus on making the feature-specific tests pass
- finally, if this breaks other, earlier tests, go back and change the tests of needed (or if they are still valid, make sure to fix the code...)

## lecture: Transactions

- example: a batch update: you might have to roll back all updates so far if one has a validation error
- read the active record transactions guide


- what does the dir-structure for spec look like?
