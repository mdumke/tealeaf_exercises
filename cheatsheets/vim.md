# vim cheatsheet

## Practical Vim

### preface

- `:h` will get you the manual
- vim can be compiled with different numbers of features. On a modern computer, user them all and compile using `--with-features=huge`
- see enabled features via `:h +feature-list`

### chapter 1: The vim way

- `.` repeats the last changes - this sounds simple but is incredibly versatile
- `>G` increases the indentation of the whole file, starting at the current line
- vim has a number of shortcuts that condense multiple instructions into one keystroke like `C`, `s`, `S`, `I`, `A`, `o`, and `O` - these examples also switch to insertion mode and can hence be used together with the `.`
- `;` repeats the last search that `f{char}` performed
- `,` reverses the find-command in the opposite direction
- replace all occurences in one file via `:%s/target/substitute/g`


## Part I: Modes

### chapter 2: Normal Mode










From the vim-tutorial book

## Basic Editing

- `i` will enter insertion-mode
- `ESC` will exit any current special mode
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` are for basic navigation
- toggle line wrapping with `:set wrap` and `set nowrap`
- `x` will delete the current letter
- use `u` for undo and `CTRL-r` for redo
- `ZZ` saves and exist
- `:w` simply saves, `:q` quits if there are no changes, and `:q!` quits anyway
- `U` undoes all changes that have been made to a particular *line*, but just while working on it
- `a` inserts *after* the cursor, in particular at the end of a line
- on unix, vim will be started in vi-compatible mode unless a `~/.vimrc` exists or it is explicitely turned off using `:set nocompatible`
- `dd` will delete the current line (and copy it to the clipboard)
- `o` will open up a new line *below* the curser, and `O` will open one *above* it
- any command can be repeated by prefixing it with a number, e.g. `2dd` will delete two lines
- there is a lot of help available, to start off, use `:help`

## Editing a little faster

- `w` moves the cursor forward one word
- `b` moves back one word
- `$` is one command that moves to the end of a line, multiples, like `2$` move down multiple lines
- `0` goes to the beginning of a line
- `^` goes to the first character in the line
- `fx` searches the current line for the next 'x' to the right
- `tx` is the same but stops 1 character before the goal
- `Fx` searches the current line for the next 'x' to the left
- `Tx` is the same but stops 1 character before the goal
- `3G` goes to line 3, just as `:3` does
- use `:set number` and `:set nonumber` to switch between displaying line number
- `CTRL-g, CTRL-g` (twice) can give a status line for where you are in a file
- `CTRL-u` and `CTRL-d` scroll half a page up and down, respectively
- `d<motion>` deleted everything the motion specifies, left or right or multiple lines or a word, as with `dw`
- `D` is a shortcut for deleting to the end of a line
- `c<motion>` is similar to `d` but leaves you in insertion mode
- `cc` deletes the line and puts you into insertion mode
- `.` repeats the last deletion or insertion commands
- `J` joint the next line into the current one, `3J` will join three lines
- `r<character>` replaces the current charater with the new one
- `~` toggles the current character's case
- `q<char>` starts recording a macro into the given char
- `@<char>` replays the makro recorded into the given char
- `:digraphs` shows a list of digraphs, which are entered via `CTRL-K` and then a sequence like, e.g. `cO` to write `Â©`

## Other stuff

- to set the syntax highlighting for, e.g. markdown, use `:set syntax=markdown`
- for a fuzzy search through files, install `CtrlP` and setup the relevant mappings; invoke with `Ctrl p` (surprise!) and navigate the results list with `Ctrl j` and `Ctrl k`, it is also possible to use ag instead of grep for searching:
