## Lecture 5

- ? Are view helper methods available in the controller?
- ? How do you write view helper functions that are only available for a certain resource?
- prior to the Rails asset pipeline you had to use third party tools to obfuscate and minify javascript and css-files
- in development, Rails will hand out the verbose versions of the assets for better readability
- browsers can typically not load more than 10 resources in parallel
- we don't want people to read our javascript too easily
- asset-pipeline: at deployment-time, Rails will minify the assets and save them to ./public/assets
- the minified assets will have a 'cache-buster' appended to their name, a large encoded string that will change with the next deployment
- in the manifest-file there is this weird `//=require something`-syntax which is part of Sprockets, which is now part of Rails and manages the asset-pipeline
- there is a rake task called `rake assets:precompile` which automates the asset-compilation. It will, by the way, also look for assets under /lib/assets
- there are two strategies for managing assets when it comes to deployment. 1) Precompile assets using the rake task and after deployment move them to the corresponding public/assets-directory, or 2) Compiling assets on deployment and directly moving them to the correct path. The latter is somewhat cleaner because it does not clutter your local repository but deployment will take longer - a bit or maybe even minutes depending on how many assets there are. Note that heroku does that automatically, so make sure there is no assets folder under public
- passwords are saved through a hash that must not encryptable by the application of course
- add a column called 'password_digest', e.g.: `add_column :users, :password_digest, :string`
- then on the user-model, add `has_secure_password` which will work together with the 'password_digest' column (make sure you have the bcrypt-ruby-gem in your Gemfile)
- bcrypt will do the actual hashing, and it comes with a salt
- in Rails 4, `has_secure_password` adds validations to the model, manage this yourself via `has_secure_password validations: false`
- `has_secure_password` gives a few methods, e.g. a virtual attribute `password` that looks for the password_digest column, and `authenticate` that takes the password and returns false (if the hashes don't match) or the (user) object if they do
- ? How much additional security does adding a salt give? [a lot, potentially because it can secure against rainbowed attacks]
- `has_secure_password` also adds a `password_confirmation`-virtual attribute. If password and password_confirmation don't match, the resource will not be saved
- it makes sense to validate a user's username for uniqueness: `validates :username, presence: true, uniqueness: true`
- as for the password, we only want to validate the password when a new user is created, not every time we update, so use `validates :password, presence: true, on: :create, length: { minimum: 3 }`
- ? What do I do when a user updates their password? Validations are turned off, aren't they?
- `get 'register', to: 'users#new'` will create a named route register_path, so you don't need 'as: register'
- to start thinking about loggin in and out, we need the concept of a 'session' that can be treated as a kind of resource
- to get nice named routes, don't use resourceful routing for sessions, instead use something like `get '/login', to: 'sessions#new'`, `post '/login', to: 'sessions#create'` and `get '/logout', to: 'sessions#destroy'`
- resources are things you want to perform CRUD-actions on, so it makes most sense to use resourceful routing for models (and not e.g. for session)
- for login use a non-model-backed form-helper, but be careful: when an error occurs and you have to render the form again, make sure to manage the original values properly like `text_field_tag :username, params[:username] || ''`
- note that at least on registration and login pages you want to have https set up (so purchase an SSL certificate and put it on the server and setup a redirect to https) because otherwise passwords will be send unencrypted
- find the user via `find_by_username`, also, because it's a non-model backed form, it is sufficient to store the user in a local variable
- Don't provide too much information when login fails (like 'We found a user but the password doesn't match...')
- after successful login, store the user_id in the session-hash: `session[:user_id] = user.id` (don't, of course, store the object itself - you'll get a cookie overflow error at some point)
- on logout, just set `session[:user_id] = nil` and redirect somewhere useful
- at the relevant locations, e.g. naviation, determine the view depending on the login-status. You might want to build a helper method called e.g. `logged_in?`
- on the application controller, write a `current_user`-method that returns either the user-object or nil
- also on the application controller, write `logged_in?` that returns true if there's a current user
- to make helper methods from the controller available in the view specify `helper_method :current_user, logged_in?, etc.`
- use memoization when looking for current_user: `@current_user ||= User.find_by_id(session[:user_id])`
- to control access to a method based on login-status, use a before-action in the respective controller, e.g `before_action :require_user, except: [:index, :show]` - require_user can be put into the Application Controller and simply do a redirect to e.g. login_path (set a nice error-flash, if you want to)
- now that you have access to a logged in user, you can set them when necessary, e.g. associate them with a post
- ? Security concern: If we only check whether or not a user is logged in, how do we know they're not accessing resources of other users?
- ? What is a good way to keep track of which action a user wanted to perform and then go there after login?
- authentication starts at the model level, and we need two things: a unique (user-)identifier and a password (stored as a one-way hash digest)
- older applications often separately stored a salt that gets added to the password before the digests are compared - this makes the password really unique - in case someone is running rainbow-queries to decrypt the hashes. Bcrypt provides that salt.
- there is a method `flash.now['notice'] = ...` that was used when a controller just rendered a view after setting the flash - as far as I can see, it now works out of the box
- it is easy to add icons with bootstrap with something like `<i class='icon-pencil'></i>` or `<span class='caret'></span>`
- to add query-strings to the url, use e.g. `user_path(@user, tab: 'comments')` which will add '?tab=comments'
- query strings can be used within a page to decide which elements to display, e.g. which links are active or whether posts or comments are displayed
- memoization can also be used in view-partials to set optional local variables to default values
- to prevent other logged-in-users from accessing restricted data, use a `before_action :require_same_user, only: [:edit, :update]` and check whether the current user (as per the session) is the same as the user from the params-hash


## Lecture 6

- polymorphic associations are a special way of establishing 1:M associations
- note that there are two types of belongs-to-relations: one is with a 'subject' (e.g. a comment was created *by* a user) and the other one with the 'object' (e.g. a comment is a comment *on* a post)
- polymorphic associations are for data that can have belongs-to-assciations with different resources on the object side (e.g. a comment can be on a post, on a video or on an image - but just one of them at a time)
- the 'traditional' 1:M approach is inelegant in that it would add foreign-key-columns for each resource that can be associated, which would produce potentially huge databases with lots of empty cells
- the polymorphic alternative would condense this down to two columns, where one has the type of associated resource and the other the id
- the Rails convention is to name the columns ending in 'able', e.g. 'commentable_type' and 'commentable_id' for comments or 'votable_type' and 'votable_id' for votes
- At the database layer, the types are just stored as strings, but it is Rails convention to use the upper camel case model names of the associated resourse, and Rails expects this for the virtual attributes to work
- because for polymorphic associations the foreign key is made up of two columns, it's called a *composite foreign key*
- to setup a composite foreign key, you can use something like `t.string :voteable_type` and `t.integer :voteable_id` in the migration. There is a shortcut for those that uses `references`, but being explicit is maybe easier to read
- At the ActiveRecord-level, on the many-side, we don't specify each belongs-to relation explicitely but refer to the associated models generally via e.g. `belongs_to :voteable, polymorphic: true`
- on the one-side, we specify the association via e.g. `has_many :votes, as: :voteable`
- just as with other associations, polymorphic associations provide getter and setter methods to setup associated object, e.g. `Vote.first.voteable = Comment.first` will populate the voteable-columns for the Vote with the Comment's data (doesn't save automatically)
- there are two alternative ways of exposing routes to handle voting: one is to have a votes-controller that needs to know which associated object to vote on, the other it to have vote-action on the resources-controller
- to realize the second alternative in the routes might look something like this: `resources :posts do member post :vote end end` which would create a vote-route under posts like `POST /posts/:id/vote => 'PostsController#vote'`. The syntax means: every member of the given resource (the resources by id) will have the new path added to it (in this case, POST ./:id/vote will be exposed)
- to expose an additional route under the index-routes for a resource, use `resources :posts do collection do get :archives end end`
- when developing a new app, start with a low-fidelity mockup (so people are willing to suggest changes), then maybe high-fidelity mockups and from there think about a table-structure that can support the mockups together with the urls and routes that can support it
- to post something, you can use `method: 'post'` to the `link_to`, which will add `data-method="post"` to the anchor-tag and then a piece of javascript which is part of jquery sends this as a post by creating a form behind the scenes - and note that it has access to the authenticity token which is in the html-head
- to pass in additional data for the post, add it to the url helper in the link_to, e.g. `link_to user_path(user, additional: 'argument', something: :else, truth: false)`
- use `redirect_to :back` to send the user back to where they came from
- note that for votes you don't follow the standard pattern of redirect-or-render in the controller because there's no form to handle, instead, redirect back in any case and just set flashes depending on whether the vote was valid or not
- Writing something like `Post.all` in your controller is dangerous code - be sure that you actually want *all* the data from your database, and not just a small set, maybe the first 15 posts or so
- the cleanest way to prevent users from voting more than once is at the validations-level, e.g. `validates_uniqueness_of :creator, scope: :voteable`
- to use html inside the flash, use `html_safe` on the string
- ? Is is possible to setup a htm-association through polymorphic associations? [Yes, e.g. like this: `has_many :votes, as: :voteable; has_many :voters, through: :votes, source: :user]`
- the shortcut for polymorphic associations in the migration is `t.references :voteable, polymorphic: true`
- if you want to write custom validators, put them into a new folder under `app/validators`
- to validate that a user cannot vote more than once on one *particular* voteable, use the `validates_uniqueness_of`-validator and pass it a scope like so: `validates_uniqueness_of :creator, scope: :voteable` or `validates_uniqueness_of :creator, scope: [:voteable_type, :voteable_id]`
- for help with heroku deployment `heroku logs` is very helpful, also `heroku restart`, there is also rename, run console, and, of, course `heroku help` plus the documentation
