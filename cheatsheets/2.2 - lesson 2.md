## Lecture 3

- you cannot simply post to a controller action because for post-requests the CSRF-token is checked, at least when `protect_from_forgery` is set on this controller (or in the application controller)
- when building a controller action, its a good idea to start with `binding.pry` just to check what gets send via the params-hash
- params is a 'HashWithIndifferentAccess' which means you can access it with strings or symbols
- a form helper in Rails would be `form_tag` which takes a path (method is post by default) and within it you can use `label_tag(:some_input)` and e.g. `text_field_tag(:some_input)
- ? Is the Authenticity Token valid for a given session? Where is it generated and when does it change?
- the label helper associates labels with inputs and is used like so: `label_for :data_field, 'Text to display'`
- for model-backed forms use `form_for @object do |f|`. This will provide new methods on f, the form-builder-object, like `f.label`, `f.text_field`, `f.submit`, etc.
- when using model-backed forms, you can only refer to attributes or virtual attributes of the model, and the form-names will have the form `name=model_name[attribute_name]`
- model-backed forms prepare the names of forms in a way that makes it easy to use them in mass-assignment. For instance, the name might be `post[title]` so it would be possible to do `Post.create(params[:post])` in the controller and have the title passed in properly
- Rails 3 uses whitelisting for mass-assignment with `attr_accessible :first_name, :last_name, ...` with the model declaration
- in Rails 4 whitelisting takes place at the action-level not at the model-layer, which makes sense because permissions depend on the current context, e.g. the current user, and the model layer is much too general to provide adequate sequrity
- wrap params in a private method and whitelist them via `params.require(:model_name).permit(:attr1, :attr2, :virtual_attr1, ...)` or use `permit!` to allow everything. You might do something like `if user.is_admin? params.require(:model_name).permit! else ...`
- a standard pattern when creating (or updating) resources: `if @item.save flash[:notice] = "all good"; redirect_to 'somewhere' else render 'new' end`
- similarly for update use `if @item.update(item_params) ...`
- validations are always added to the model layer like so `validated :title, presence: true`, but they can get quite complicated
- failing validations will populate `model_name.errors`. Messages can be accessed easily via `model_name.error.full_messages`
- why does Rails store error messages on the object? Because this way we can just render the form again (this is also why we use render instead of redirect)
- to handle errors, you might want to check with `@model_name.errors.any?` and then iterate through the errors
- rails will wrap input elements which have an id for which an error exists with a `field-with-error`-div
- `form_for` will pre-populate input fields when it is passed an existing object
- behing the scenes, http PATCH is simulated by Rails by using a POST to a resource_path/:id and passing a hidden field with name '_method' and value 'patch'. The form tag will generate this automatically when you pass in an existing post
- we can use a before_filter (Rails 3) or before_action (Rails 4) to e.g. setup instance variables before certain actions, e.g. `before_action :set_post, only: [:show, :edit, :update]`
- there are two typical use cases for before-actions: setting up instance variables and redirecting on some conditions, e.g. to check for login
- generating forms for nested resources is a bit more involved. `form_for` will now take an array of arguments like `form_for [@parent, @child]` where the parent must be an existing object
- notice the difference: you redirect to a *path*, but you render a *template*
- `new_record?` is a method to check whether or not an object has been saved to the db. This can be useful e.g. in determining if a button should say 'create' or 'update'


## Lecture 4

- if you want to render a view from another controller, make sure you have all the instance variables set up
- one of the first things you do when you desing a new app is thinking about the urls, that's more or less part of the mock up already because urls are part of the interface
- `link_to` usually takes the title first and then the path to go to, but it can also take the path first and then the title via a block, which is helpful if you want to do more sophisticated titles that involve, say, substitution
- you don't want your models to be concerned with presentation-level concerns (like prefixing a url with http). So don't clutter your models with instance methods to be called from the views. This is where helper methods come in.
- helpers correlate with view templates, and if you need something in all views, put it unter the application helper
- a rails convention for name-attributes in html-forms: the name has to end with empty brackets if it expects an array like structure (e.g. 'options[]' for multiple select values)
- use form helpers for select-forms or checkboxes as well: this will e.g. automatically fill in the correct values and generate the correct naming
- note that rails helpers for selects and checkboxes can be quite involved because of a lot of naming conventions. Be sure to have the target-html in mind when getting into the helpers
- in the strong parameter-permissions, for an array to be permitted use something like `.permit(:title, category_ids: [])` to whitelist the whole array
- use nested resources to prevent your top-level namespace from being cluttered
- while there is a problem with the form_for-checkbox-helper, there is a `collection_check_box`-helper that will be useful (but is a bit involved to set up)
- REST stands for "REpresentational State Transfer"



## Rails Forms Guide

- one of the simplest forms is a search form. To create one, use something like `form_tag('/search', method: 'get')` . Always use the get-verb, so people can bookmark the search-results!
- the form-helpers (like text_field_tag, label_tag, etc.) all take the name-attribute as their first argument and will make this name retrievable from the params-hash
- be careful with naming conventions when creating forms!
- use an 'array_name[item_name]'-structure when generating a collection of results, e.g. for checkboxes
- '"person[address][city]"' will be transformed to `{ 'person' => { 'address' => { 'city' => 'value_of_input'}}}`.
- when name-attributes end with empty brackes like 'category[]' then the values of all inputs with that name will be collected into an array
- to get some standard layout for checkboxes with rails-helpers, put the label after the checkbox and place all checkboxes within a 'fieldset' that has a class of 'checkbox' (similarly use a class 'radio' for radio-buttons)
- the label-tag uses the `for`-attribute to associate a label with an input field. The relevant connection is determined by the name of the input in the html-file, so e.g. when setting up a search field one might use `search_field('user', 'first_name')` which generates an input with `name=user[first_name]`, so the corresponding label has to be generated with `label_tag('user[first_name]')`
- to directly bind a form to a model object, use `form_for`, which takes an instance of the model and a block that specifies the form, more precisely, form_for will yield a form-builder object and you call the helper methods on this object
- `form_for` can also specify url- and html-options and a namespace to ensure ids are unique
- `form_for` is smart enough to figure out the proper http-method if none is specified: new records will be posted to the resources-path while existing ones will be patched to the resource-path
- `form_for` can also deal with namespaced routes, e.g. when there is an admin namespace, generate a form via `form_for [:admin, @article]`
- options for select-tags can be generated using the `options_for_select`-helper and the select-helper
- there is a shortcut for generating select-options from a collection. Here you can use `f.collection_select(:city_id, City.all, :id, :name)` to create a select-tag with all cities as options, each displaying its name and having the id as the value
- the `check_box` helper method skrews up the model-form because is adds hidden fields. Use the `check_box_tag`-helper instead
- note that if you you want to mass-assign an array of values you have to permit this values, e.g. `permit(:title, category_ids: [])`


## migrations review

- migrations are for setting up the database structure, they execute 'Data Definition Statements' as opposed to query statements
- to see a list of rake tasks that are related to the database, run `rake -T | grep db`
- if migrations don't run cleanly end-to-end (which they always should!), you can use schema.rb to setup the database via `rake db:schema:load` (from the rails root directory)
- instead of putting data-changes in the migrations, create a rake task that does that (also don't use seeds for that, they're just meant for setting up the application on start)
