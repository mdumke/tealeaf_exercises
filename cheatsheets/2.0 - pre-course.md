## relational databases

- find the text at http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/intro-ruby-relational-db.html
- because Rails lets you choose a database backend, it only allows for a limited number of general types to be used within a schema, they are: `:string, :text, :integer, :float, :decimal, :datetime, :timestamp, :time, :date, :binary, ` and `:boolean`
- if you have lots of data that doesn't fit easily into relational databases (e.g. lots of hierarchical information), look for some other kind of tool
- it is possible but very inconvenient to represent many-to-many relationships with two tables, each of which would have multiple (but how many?) foreign keys; The better way to solve these problems is through a third table that just connects the ids
- when designing databases, the question of *granularity* is important: how small should our units of information be? e.g. do we want to record the first name and last name separately or together. This has to be decided in the context of the application, but in general it is easier to put smaller pieces together than to break larger ones apart.
- For combining smaller pieces Rails has a `composed_of` method
- The purpose of Active Record is to abstract from writing SQL queries by hand, but in case you need them, there is a `find_by_sql`-method


## Introduction to SQL

- find the resources at http://sqlbolt.com/

### SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101

- simplest query: `SELECT col1, col2 FROM my_items;`
- get the complete dump with `SELECT * FROM my_items;`

### SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)

- conditions can be specified using WHERE and will be applied to every row in a table to check if it should be included in the result
- use multiple conditions like so: `SELECT col1, col2 FROM mytable WHERE condition1 AND / OR condition2 ... `
- common conditionals are
- `=, !=, < <=, >, >=` (numerical operators)
- `col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5` (number in a range)
- `col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10`
- `col_name IN (2, 4, 6)` (element exists in a list)
- `col_name NOT IN (2, 4, 6)`

### SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (Pt. 2)

- when working with text-data, use `=` and `!=` or `<>` for *case sensitive* and *exact* string comparisons
- use `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` for *case insensitive* yet still *exact* comparisons
- in combination with `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` it is possible to use wildcars, namely `%` to match zero or more characters (e.g. `col_name LIKE "%AT%"`) and `_` to match a single character (e.g. `col_name LIKE "AN_"`)
- all strings must be in quotes, but remember that postgres uses single quotes
- to perform efficient full-text search, don't use plain SQL but use libraries like *Apache Lucene* or *Sphinx*.

### SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results

- to remove all duplicates from a query result, use `SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2, ...`
- results can be ordered via `select ... from ... where ... ORDER BY colx ASC / DESC;`
- to restrict the number of results, use limit to specify the number to return and offset to specify where to begin: `SELECT ... LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;`
- limiting usually happens at the end of the query

### SQL Lesson 6: Multi-table queries with JOINs

- the process of breaking large datasets into smaller parts (tables) is called normalization
- to recombine tables and search across them, use joins
- in many SQL-implementations inner joins are just called joins
- when performing inner joins a cross product of the tables is generated and the rows that fulfill the `on` condition are selected
- schematic usage: `SELECT ... FROM my_table INNER JOIN another_table ORDER BY ...`

### SQL Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs

- in a `LEFT JOIN` all rows from the first table will be kept, even if there are no matching rows in the second
- a `RIGHT JOIN` keeps all the rows from the second table regardless
- a `FULL JOIN` keeps all rows event if there are no matching rows in the other tables
- missing values will be filled in with NULL-values, so we will likely have to deal with those

### SQL Lesson 8: A short note on NULLs

- NULL values are annoying because we have to specifically deal with them, so try to use sensible default-values if possible
- note that it is not always possible to avoid NULLs, e.g. when doing outer joins
- to handle those cases, use `WHERE colname IS / IS NOT NULL`

### SQL Lesson 9: Queries with expressions

- beyond querying raw data it is possible to use expressions and mathematical and string functions
- which functions are available depends on the respective database - rtfm
- use the keyword `AS` to specify aliases, e.g. `SELECT column AS better_column_name ... FROM my_table AS better_table_name_or_abbreviation ...`

### SQL Lesson 10: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 1)

- common aggregate functions are `count, min, max, avg` and `sum`
- note that `count(*)` counts all rows while `count(colname)` will only count non-null row
- use aliases for readability
- `GROUP BY colname` can be used to group by unique values in the given column
- without grouping the functions will aggregate over all data

### SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

- using `HAVING` it is possible to filter after grouping in order to select only some groups
- general schema: `SELECT ... WHERE condition GROUP BY colname HAVING group_condition;`

### SQL Lesson 12: Order of execution of a Query

- note that expressions in the select part of a query are computed *after* where-conditions, grouping and having-conditions have been applied, hence aliases from the select part are typically not accessible by the other parts

### SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows

- to simply add rows to my_table, use `INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (v11, v12, v13), (v21, v22, v23), ...;`
- you can also specify a subset of columns to set values for: `INSERT INTO my_table (col2, col5) VALES (v12, v15), (v22, v25), ...;
- note that specifying columns explicitely is forward compatible because you can later add a column to the table without having to rewrite the insert statement

### SQL Lesson 14: Updating rows

- general syntax is `UPDATE my_table SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2, ... WHERE condition`;
- this will update the fields in *all* rows that are specified by the where clause
- note: mistakes with updates are common and annyoing, to avoid damage, first perform a select query to test the condition, making sure you update the correct rows

### SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows

- general syntax: `DELETE FROM my_table WHERE condition;`
- the where clause is optional and can be left out to clear the table completely
- test the where condition before executing the delete

### SQL Lesson 16: Creating tables

- general syntax: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_table ( col1 data_type, col2, data_type, ...);
- in addition to the data type, we can also specify optional table constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `AUTOINCREMENT`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL` or `FOREIGN KEY`
- it is also possible to specify default values for each column so a full-blown specification may look like so: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE DEFAULT "", ...`.
- common data types are `INTEGER, BOOLEAN, FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL, CHARACTER(num_chars), VARCHAR(num_chars), TEXT, DATE, DATETIME,` and `BLOB` for binary data.

### SQL Lesson 17: Altering tables

- columns can be added via `ALTER TABLE mytable ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint DEFAULT default_value;`
- not all SQL-implementations allow for removing columns, but if they do, use `ALTER TABLE mytable DROP column_to_be_deleted;` to achieve this
- rename a table with `ALTER TABLE mytable RENAME TO new_table_name;`

### SQL Lesson 18: Dropping tables

- `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;` will remove the table from the database, including its schema
- note that if other tables have foreing keys to this table you might have to do some cleanup


## Getting Started with Rails

- working through the getting started with Rails guide at `http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html`

### 3 Creating a New Rails Project

- create a new project using `rails new /path/to/project`
- to see all command line options for generating a new project, use `rails new -h`

### 4 Hello, Rails!

- to automatically generate controllers, use `bin/rails g(enerate) controller controller_name action_name`

### 5 Getting Up and Running

- When a file is called something like `index.html.erb`, this specifies the *format* to be html and the *handler* to be erb
- forms are created using a form builder, the basic form builder in rails being `form_for`
- `form_for` takes an object for which that form is, an optional url where the data should be posted, and in a block the different labels and form fields can then be specified, e.g. in erb:
- `<%= form_for :article, url: articles_path do |f| %>`
- `  <%= f.label :title %>`
- `  <%= f.text_field :title %>`
- `  <%= f.submit %>`
- the params-hash can be rendered to the view for inspection writing `render plain: params.inspect` within the controller action
- note that the keys of the params-hash can be accessed as keys or as symbols
- the rails generator for models can automatically create migrations with correct fields, use it like so: `bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text`
- note that the model name is upper(camel)case and singular
- to run a migration in a different enviromnent than the development, specify this using e.g. `bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production`
- we can create a new model-instance using `MyModel.new(params[:my_model])`, but only if we have allowed the parameters to be assigned ('strong parameters')
- whitelisting parameters works like follows: `MyModel.new(params.require(:my_model).permit(:attribute1, :attribute2))` but it is common to factor this out into a private method that can be reused, e.g. `def my_model_params; params.require(...); end`
- the typical order for CRUD actions within a controller is `index, show, new, edit, create, update and destroy`
- `link_to` is a rails view helper. Specify where the link should go either by explicitely giving controller and optional action if the action if other than index (`link_to 'Link Text', controller: 'users'`) or using a path_helper (`link_to 'Link Text', new_user_path`)
- you don't need to specify the `:controller`-option if you want to link to an action within the same controller
- to render another action within the same controller, just say `render 'other_action'`
- there is a rails helper method the determine the correct numerus of a word depending on a given number: `pluralize(how_many, "error")`
- when saving fails, error messages on an object are available via `my_obj.errors.full_messages` or `my_obj.errors.messages`
- fields that contain errors are automatically wrapped by rails in a div with class `field_with_errors`
- the `form_for` method automatically populates data-fields with fields of the object passed to it
- `form_for` also takes an optional method argument, e.g. `method: :patch` to update objects
- `form_for` can also be simplified: if we stick to the REST-protocol, there is no need to specify the action and method, Rails will infer this
- render a partial within the given current model simply with e.g. `render 'form'` for `_form.html.erb`
- the `link_to`-method takes additional arguments that specify data-attributes and request-method, as in e.g. `link_to 'Delete', article_path(@article), method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' }` (note that the confirm-box that pops up here needs jquery_ujs)
- when generating a new model, specify `another_model:references` (the model is singular) to add a foreign key to the migration
- `form_for` also takes an array as an argument in order to create nested routes, e.g. `form_for([@article, @article.comments.build])`
- here, `build` is similar to `new` in that it returns an unsaved instance of a Comment, but this one has the correct foreign-key already set. We can also create an automatically linked comment via `@article.comments.create(comment_params)`
- in order to render all comments for an article, we can use a `_comment`-partial and simply call `render @article.comments`, which will iterate over all comments and pass each one as `comment` to the partial
- `link_to` also accepts an array of resources to find out where to go, e.g. `link_to 'Go', [comment.article, comment]` will link to `/articles/:article_id/comments/:id`
- to do very simple authenication use at the top of a controller: `http_basic_authenticate_with name: 'm', password: '123', except: [:index, :show]`
- instead of :except we can also specify :only to select which actions to authenticate


## Create a new rails project

- when there are multile rails version for the current ruby version, you can specify on startup which one is to be used, in this case: `rails _4.0.0_ new myapp`
- there is a generator for resources that provides basic CRUD functionality: `rails g scaffold User name:string email:string`
- inspect the sqlite-database from the command line: `sqlite3 db/development.sqlite` and get general information via `.tables` and `.schema some_table`
- if I generate a new rails app and start up the console, I get a warning about a cirular argument reference, but this happens only with rails 4.0.0


## Active Record Associations

- Active Record supports six types of associations: `belongs_to , has_one , has_many , has_many :through , has_one :through, has_and_belongs_to_many`
- with `has_many`-associations, it is easy to generate new instances with the correct foreign key, e.g. `some_customer.orders.create(...)`, but why does this not work for `has_one`-relationships like `some_supplier.account.create(...)? - Because you have to use `some_supplier.create_account(...)` (see below)
- join models are automatically created but don't seem to be automatically destroyed. When I do e.g. `some_physician.patients.create(...)` it will create an empty appointment as well, but if I then delete the physician and the patient, the appointment will remain. Maybe I have to use `dependent: :destroy`? - No, the idea is not to remove the models but only the join! This is done via something like this: some_physician.patients.delete(Patient.find(23))`
- passing `true` to e.g. `some_customer.orders(true)` will discard the cache that might have been kept from the last time the orders query was performed
- in `has_and_belongs_to_many`-associations the join-table is expected to have a name that is a composite of the lexicographically ordered model names, e.g. the join table for `parts` and `assemblies` will be `assemblies_parts` (because assemblies is lexicographically less)

### 4.1 belongs_to Association Reference

- declaring a `belongs_to`-association adds five methods to the model: `associated_object(force_reload = false), associated_object=(associate), build_associated_object(attributes = {}), create_associated_object(attributes = {}), create_associated_object!(attributes = {})
- associated objects can be forced to be reloaded by passing `true` to avoid caching issues, e.g. `Order.first.customer(true)`
- note that if you build or create an association from a model you have to save the model itself again to update the respective foreign keys

### 4.2 has_one Association Reference

- declaring a `has_one`-association adds the same methods as `belongs_to`: `associated_object(force_reload = false), associated_object=(associate), build_associated_object(attributes = {}), create_associated_object(attributes = {}), create_associated_object!(attributes = {})
- note: it is often helpful to customize the query that is performed to find the associated model, for this you can use scopes like `has_one :account, -> { where active: true }`

### 4.3 has_many Association Reference

- declaring a `has_many`-association automatically adds 16 methods for operating on the associated object-collection
- ? What's the difference between destroying and deleting associated objects?
- associated collections can be queried with e.g. `Customer.first.orders.find(3)` or `Customer.first.orders.where(order_number: 123)`

### 4.5 Association Callbacks

- there are four association callbacks: `before_add, after_add, before_remove, after_remove`
- callbacks are specified with the association declaration, e.g. `has_many :orders, before_add: :call_this_method_that_is_defined_below_and_pass_in_the_object_to_be_added`
- it is also possible to specify multiple callbacks by providing them in an array
