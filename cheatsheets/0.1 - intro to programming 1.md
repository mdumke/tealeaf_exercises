# Introduction to Programming with Ruby, part I

## Preparations
- use pry for debugging with: `require 'pry'` and `binding.pry`
- pry will open a repl, where you can check and manipulate variables in the current environment

## The Basics
- symbols, `:some_sym`, are used when something is neither intended to be *printed* to the screen nor *changed*
- print to STDOUT with `$stdout.puts stuff` (or just `puts stuff`) and to STDERR with `$stderr.puts error`
- type-conversion `'123.4'.to_i` will convert all leading ciphers to an integer
- the new hash-syntax as of Ruby 1.9 is `key: value`, not `:key => value` (except where the key is not an integer)

## Variables
- be aware of the different variable types
1. CONSTANT
2. $global_var
3. @@class_var
4. @instance_var
5. local_var

## Control Flow
- the case-statement can be used without an argument! Just `case` and then provide a number of conditionals in the `when`-clauses and the first matching option will be taken
- there are only two falsy values in Ruby: nil and false

## Loops and Iterators
- The simplest loop construct is `loop do...`
- all looping constructs have return values, usually either the collection they loop over or nil
- `break` and `next` work as expected
- the while-loop has a counterpart, the until-loop
- to create a do-while-loop, add a breaking-condition to a simle loop. It is not recommended to use the `begin...end while`-construct

## Arrays
- some useful array-methods would be `indlude?`, `sort`, `each_index`, `each_with_index`, `flatten`
- it might be a good idea to double-check whether or not an array-method is destructive
- to transform a range into an array, use e.g. `Array(1..3)`

## Hashes
- hashes have helpful iterator-methods, e.g. each_key, each_value, keys, values, each
- merge hashes with merge or merge!

## Files
- create a new file using the File-object: `file = File.new('test.txt', 'w+')
- or open the file with `file = File.open(...)`
- make it a habit close files: `file.close`
- some common modes are: `r` (read only), `w` (write only), `w+` (read and over-write), `a+` (read and append)
- read-mode is default, so we do not have to specify this
- to read from a file, simply use `File.read('filename')` to get the complete content as a string or `File.readlines('filename')` to have each line as an array-element
- to write to a file, use `file.write` or `file.puts` which puts a newline-character at the end
- a file is a stream, just like `$stdout` or `$stderr`, so we can simply write or put(s) to it
- No need to call `file.close` when working with blocks like `File.open('filename', 'w') {|f| f.write('...')}`
- Delete files with `File.delete('filename')
- opening a file in mode 'w' or 'w+' will truncate an existing file to zero
- use the Dir-class to inspect and manipulate directories, e.g.
- `Dir.entries('.')` lists the contents of the current directory
- `Dir.foreach('.') do |f| ...` is an iterator over all entries in the directory
- `Dir.getwd` returns the absolute path to the current working directory
- `Dir.chdir('path')` changes the directory
- `Dir.mkdir('name')` and `Dir.rmdir('name')` can be used to create and delete directories
- the Pathname-class can help with manipulating file paths, use as in `pn = Pathname.new(fileobj_or_path_as_str)`
- Some file classes and helpful ruby classes would be:
1. csv: use CSV-class
2. xls: use axslx-library
3. json: Ruby standard library
4. xml: Nokigiri-library

## More Stuff
- a simple regexp-match can be checked with `"str" =~ /epx/`
- a MatchData object is returned when using the match-method, this object has all relevant data stored, e.g.
- `/(\w{2})-(\w{3})/.match("abc-def").captures` will show a list of the captured groups and subgroups
- methods can take blocks as arguments, just note that 1) the block must come last, and 2) the name has to start with an &
- procs can be defined by instantiating the Proc-object: `say = Proc.new { |x, y, z| puts x }` and executed via `say.call('A', 'B', 'C')`

## Workbook
- the String-class has a helpful `prepend`-method
- `Kernel.eval("p 'Some test'")` evaluates the string as if it was an actual method call
- `{ a: 1, b: 2 }.assoc(:b)` returns the corresponding key-value-pair as an array
- the Hash-class has methods #member?, #include? and #key? to check for the existence of a certain key
- note that #downcase is not destructive
- Hash#merge! is equivalent to Hash#update
- when declaring arrays of strings `%w(s1, s2)` and `%w[s1, s2]` are equivalent (but Rubocop prefers the round brackets)
- the set operation `[1, 2, 2] | [3]` will produce an array with unique elements
- the String#scan-method returns an array of all occurrences that meet a regexp-condition the given string, e.g. `'abc'.scan(/[ab]/)`
- lambda expressions can be used in case statements like `case age; when lambda { |age| age > 65 }`
- `arr << x` and `arr += [x]` have the same return value, but the first method is destructive, the latter one not
- to break a string into words, use split, consider splitting on non-word characters (`/\W/`)
