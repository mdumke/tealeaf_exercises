## some setup issues

### using vim to write .md files
- by default, vim uses markdown-highlighting only for .markdown extensions, so use
- `:set syntax=markdown` for temporary fixing or add this to .vimrc:
- `au BufNewFile,BufFilePre,BufRead *.md set filetype=markdown`

### How to solve the fish / tmux - issues
- tip: when changing /etc/tmux.conf, make sure all tmux-processes have stopped before you start another session, otherwise you might not see the changes
- create ~/.config/fish/config.fish if it does not exist and from here, source the rvm-scripts like so:
  `bash "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"`
- make sure the PATH-variable is ok, i.e. it starts with the rvm-path and there is no unnecessary repetition
- remember, the order of loading is: `~/.bash_profile` sources `~/.profile` sources `~/.bashrc`
- you need a bash-wrapper for fish which can be integrated as fish-functions, check out rvm-fish-integration and download a piece of code to put in `~/.config/fish/functions/rvm.fish`

### Testing with minitest
- in your spec, use `require 'minitest/autorun'
- from the spec, link to the code-file with `require_relative 'my_file'`
- general structure: describe-block, before-blocks, it-blocks
- matchers are `must_equal`, `wont_equal`, `must_be_instance_of`
- use a Rakefile to execute the testsuite

### Postgres stuff

- some helpful commands when working with postgres:
- `\l` list all databases
- `\du` list all users
- `\q` quit
- `drop database db_name;` to delete a database
- `create database db_name;` to set up a new database with the current user as owner
- `drop user user_name;` or `drop role user_name;` to delete a user
- `create user user_name:` to setup a new user
- `grant all privileges on database db_name to user_name;`
- on ubuntu, there is by default a root user defined but defined cannot login, if you have to become user postgres, use `sudo su - postgres`
- when peer-authentication fails on your local machine, turn it to md5-authentication in the host-based-authentication (hba) file: open (my current installations) `/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf`, go to the end of the file and change the authentication method for users trying to log in from localhost: `local all all md5`
- give a user superuser privileged with `alter user myuser with superuser;`

### git basics revisited

- from the github training youtube channel
- git has a very small footprint and hence works well with small bandwidths
- git is composable, it is actually build of a suite of small tools that can be orchestrated using shell scripts
- for installment, it would be enough to but the binaries on your $PATH, no registry entries requiered
- creating a repository now starts locally, you don't have to ask a priviliged administrator to set up a repository for you anymore
- create a repo: `git init` or `git init my_project` to create a corresponding subfolder
- to ungit a directory, it is sufficient to simply remove the .git repository
- there is `http://teach.github.com` that has a range of materials
- to push a new branch, you can say `git push -u origin new_feature_branch`
- to contribute to an existing repository, fork it, create a new branch, work on it, push the branch, and create a pull-request so someone can merge the branch, or have a discussion before merging (or closing)
- change the remote address for the repo with `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user_name/project_name.git`

## RSpec environment

- spring can preload the environment for running tests; add `gem 'spring-commands-rspec'` to the Gemfile and create the binstubs using `spring binstub --all`
- binstubs are wrappers around the executables, making sure an environment is loaded before execution
- in the beginning, spring is not running in the background, as `spring status` will show
- now run rpsec and measure the time: `time bin/rspec`
- after that, spring will have started, as `spring status` will verify
- a second execution of rspec will show a significant difference in execution time
- instead of `bin/rspec` you can also run `spring rspec`
- to use guard, include `gem 'guard-rspec'` (*not* `guard-rails`...) in the Gemfile
- create a Guardfile using `guard init`. This will specify which directories to watch and how to call rspec
- make sure it's running rspec with spring: `guard :rspec, cmd: "spring rspec" do`
- now in a separate terminal, start up guard via `guard` and it will start up spring and check for file or test changes
- note: if you change something basic and need to restart, make sure you first stop guard and spring `spring stop` and then start gurad again
