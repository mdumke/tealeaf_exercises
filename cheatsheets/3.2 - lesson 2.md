## lecture: The build in Rspec Matchers

- be careful with testing object identity, maybe you mean object equivalence
- read through the RSpec docs and watch out for differences in RSpec 3

## lecture: Writing controller tests with Rspec

- controller tests in Rails are typically located at the level of functional tests
- tests go in spec/controllers
- here's a controller spec-exampl

```ruby
describe TodosController do
  describe "GET index" do # context for each action
    it 'sets the @todos variable' do
      cook = Todo.create(name: 'cook')
      sleep = Todo.create(name: 'sleep')

      get :index
      assigns(:todos).should == [cook, sleep]
    end

    it 'renders the index template' do
      # first trigger the http request
      get :index

      # then check the response
      response.should render_template :index
    end
  end

  describe "GET new" do
    it 'sets the @todo variable' do
      get :new
      assigns(:todo).should be_new_record
      assigns(:todo).should be_instance_of(Todo)
    end

    it 'renders the new template' do
      get :new
      response.should render_template :new
    end
  end

  describe "POST create" do
    it 'creates the todo record when the input is valid' do
      post :create, todo: {name: 'cook', descriptions: 'this is a valid input'}

      Todo.first.name.should == 'cook'
      Todo.first.description.should == 'this is a valid input'
    end

    it 'redirects to the root path when the input is valid' do
      post :create, todo: {name: 'cook', descriptions: 'this is a valid input'}

      response.should redirect_to root_path
    end

    it 'does not create a todo when the input is invalid' do
      post :create, todo: {descriptions: 'this is an in valid input'}

      Todo.count.should == 0
    end

    it 'renders the new template when the input is invalid' do
      post :create, todo: {descriptions: 'this is an in valid input'}

      response.should render_template :new
    end
  end
end
```

## lecture: Dealing with Cardinality and Boundary Conditions in TDD

- when testing, write tests for 0, 1, many, and boundary conditions (like, e.g. no more than foulike, e.g. no more than four

## lecture: Refactor in TDD

- TDD process: add features in the red phase, refactor in green
- a good first step: pull some complex code out and give it a name
- make sure your public interface is clean and readable, for private methods this is maybe not as important
- develop from the outside in

## lecture: An alternative style of RSpec

- rspec offers a number of ways to make tests dryer
- use `let` to make a variable available in the tests

```ruby
describe '#some_method' do
  let(:todo) { Todo.create(name: 'cook dinner' }
end
```

- this will make a variable named 'todo' available in all following tests in this describe-block
- we can also specify a task that gets done repeatedly, so e.g. we can do the following substitution

```ruby
let(:subject) { todo.do_something }

it 'has some result'
  # todo.do_something.should == 'some result'
  subject.should == 'some result'
end
```

- and we can even substitute `subject { todo.do_something }` for `let(:subject) ...`
- we can use context and within context have before-blocks:

```ruby
context 'displays this and that' do
  before { todo.some(set: 'up' }

  it 'runs the rest of the test' do
    expect(subject).to be_a Success
  end
end
```

- it can be helpful to give each test case a context (and give the context a useful name)
- when the test itself just has the form

```ruby
it 'some_descriptions' do
  subject.should == something
end
```

- we can shorten this whole block to `it { should == something }`
- the problem with this style can be that when you have a lot of tests the definition of the test cases can be further up in the file, far from the point where it is actually used
- let-blocks are lazily evaluated, or use `let!` for eager evaluation


## lecture: single assertion principle

- for every test case, you should only have one assertion
- if you're using the word 'and' in your specs, that's a good indicator you're testing too many things
- but note that when tests are very related, they can sometimes be grouped together


## lecture: object generation using Fabrication

- when the specifications of a model change, you'd have to go through all you tests and change to models
- also, when a model requires a lot of attributes to be present, your object definitions will become very lengthy
- this course recommends *Fabrication*
- put fabricators under `spec/fabricators/my_fabricator.rb`
- the syntax is as follows:

```ruby
Fabricator(:todo) do
  name { "cooking" }
end
```
- and now in the specfile we can simply say `Fabricate(:todo)`
- in order to have associated objects, without a framework we would have to setup the associated objects first and then the one we're interested in and then set up the association
- with Fabrication, this works as follows:

```ruby
Fabricator(:todo) do
  name { "cooking" }
  user
end
```

- the `user` line is a shortcut for `user { Fabricate(:user) }`.
- to just have an in-memory object, use `Fabric.build(:todo)`.


## lecture: Generating Fake Data

- Fabrication has 'sequences' that let us create different versions of data
- The faker-gem is easy to use for this task, use it via `Faker::Lorem.words(5).join(' ')`

## Writing controller tests

- if you need authenticated users, create a context and use a before-block to set a session[:user_id]
- its not necessary to test that a default view is being rendered
- but you might want to test that an unauthenticated user is redirected
- if you only want to run a certain test, put a line number behind the filename like so: `bin/rspec spec/controllers/videos_controller_spec.rb:23`
- Fabricator brings a helpful methods `Fabricate.attributes_for(:some_model)` which does not create the model itself
- To check if a flash message has been set, use `expect(flash['notice']).not_to be_blank`
- To test against an array without caring for the order, use `=~` or `match_array`
- When writing tests, go through the setup, action, and verification steps, but if you don't know how to do the setup, start with the action and then find out what's missing
- Say we want to create a comment for a Post, so in the controller, we build a new comment and associate it with the post. But when the comment cannot be saved, it will still show up in `@post.comments`. To avoid this in case we need the comments in the next view, call `@post.comments.reload`
- The delegation-pattern: `def category; video.category; end` can be written as `deletage :category, to: :video`
- another example: `def video_title; video.title; end` is equivalent to `delegate :title, to: :video, prefix: :video`
