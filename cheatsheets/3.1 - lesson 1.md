## lecture: The Rationale behind Testing

- what are the alternatives to testing? Well, no tests, which means that the customers do the testing for you...
- Or a QA team, which first of all creates organizational problems (mistrust, problematic communication, nobody likes the QA team, they are often just junior developers), and also, because developers and QA team want as much time as possible, release cycles get longer
- without automated tests, people tend to care less about code quality, developers tend to get lazy
- also, without automated tests, developers that are not very familiar with the code, do not dare to touch it (isolated knowledge)
- and, finally, how do you know things actually work? And you didn't break anything? (regression)

## lecture: Technical Debt

- when writing automated tests, it will cost you some time in the beginning, but at a certain point, when the size of a project grows, it will be faster to add new features
- *technical debt* refers to the increased efforts you have to make at later stages to further develop a project
- the first step of every attempt to rescue a project is to write a test suite

## lecture: Unit, Funtional, and Integrations Tests

- Unit tests test models, views, helpers and routes all on their own
- Functional tests in the context of Rails typically refer to controller tests (making sure different parts are working together)
- Integration tests emulate the end-user behavior
- this course will focus on unit and functional tests and integration tests will only come into play for the most important business workflows
- unit tests can be written faster because the code is closer to the actual code
- integration tests involve a lot of components and possible permutations (hard to get a lot test coverage) and they are the slowest

## lecture: First tests on RSpec

- include the `rspec-rails` gem (in development and test groups) and run `rails generate rspec:install`
- to create a test for a model, create a file `spec/models/my_model_spec.rb` and put some test code here:

    require 'spec_helper' # will load the Rails environment and the relevant class

    describe Todo do
    end

- this is already the simplest test, run it with `rspec`
- RSpec is a tool for specifying behavior, think BDD more than TDD
- now let's put a simple test in the describe-block:

  it 'is perfect' # will be marked as pending if there's not a block

  it 'saves itself' do
    # 1. setup step
    todo = Todo.new(name: 'cook dinner')

    # 2. perform some action
    todo.save

    # 3. verify the result is as expected
    Todo.first.name.should == 'cook dinner'
  end

- The rspec-team now favors the expect-syntax, but should is not going to be deprecated
- running the rspec command will search the spec-directory and look for all files that end in `_spec.rb`
- there is a rails-plugin for vim that can automatically create some boilerplate code when generating spec-files
- it is a good practice for has-many associations to specify a default order via, e.g. `has_many :videos -> { order('title') }`
- testing validations can be done by testing if the model is not valid or by trying so save and making sure the database is empty afterwards
- shoulda_matchers can be used by first including the gem ('shoulda-matchers', sufficient to put into the test-group)
- do not test ActiveRecord basic functionality: only test the code that you own
- to see an exhaustive list of rake tasks, run `rake -T -A`
- use `rake db:reset` to reseed

## lecture: Development and Test Databases

- prior to rails 4.1. it was necessary to run `rake db:migrate db:test:prepare` to setup the testing environment

## lecture: GitHub flow and code review process

- find the article at `http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html`
- central ideas: the code on the masterbranch id deployable!
- develop new features on their own branches, and push them regularly using `git push origin my_feature_branch`
- then create pull requests for discussion or merging (from the module branch to the master branch)

## From test later to Test Driven

- different strategies in a kind of continuum:
- 'code first, test later' is a good strategy to guard against regressions
- 'code a little, test a little' is basically the same, just with a smaller feedback loop
- 'Test first development': write failing tests first; makes you think about what you want to do first
- 'Test Driven Development': use tests to drive the implementation, not just to fix a behavior
- 'Test Driven Design': driving the whole architecture and software desing with tests
- which one is appropriate depends, of course, on the problem

## TDD and Red-Green-Refactor

- in order to add some new behavior, add a describe-block and just list a few test conditions in `it`-statements
- when implementing a function, start by writing the easiest code to make the tests true at first, even if this means starting with trivial code like returning `true` at first
- this process is called 'triangulation' because it is easier to determine one's position when multiple other positions are known

## Custom Form Builders

- if it's to cumbersome to explicitely handle error messages every time we need a form, it is possible to write a custom form builder
- for instance, we couls add a file 'app/helpers/my_form_builder.rb' and overwrite the label method:

    class MyFormBuilder < ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder
      def label(method, text = nil, options = {}, &block)
        errors = object.errors[method.to_sym]

        if errors
          text += " <span class=\"error\">#{ errors.first }</span>
        end

        super(method, text.html_safe, options, &block)
      end
    end

- then, when contructing a form, we can specify to use the custom builder: `form_for @post, builder: MyFormBuilder do |f| ... end`
- this can be simplified even further by overwriting form_for in the application_helper.rb like, e.g.

    module ApplicationHelper
      def my_form_for(record, options = {}, &proc)
        form_for(record, options.merge!({builder: MyFormBuilder}), &proc)
      end
    end
- it is common to have a pages controller for static pages like the front page

## Custom Form Bilders in the Wild

- *formtastic* brings its own DSL
- *simple form* works well with Bootstrap and Foundation, but is hard to work with when your forms deviate from the expected standard (for e.g. it decides which input field to use depending on the input type)
- *bootstrap_form* is close to the rails formbuilders and does not bring a heavy DSL, but automates the bootstrap-related html-boilerplate (control groups, etc.)
- note that we can send a notice with a redirect, so save the flash: `redirect_to root_path, notice: 'successfully signed out'`
- a signed in user should not be confronted with the front page or sign in page
